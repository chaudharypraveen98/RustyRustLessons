It is a way of writing generalized algorithms in such a way that can be used for the types specified later. It can be initialized for a specified type with help of parameters.

## What we use generics:-
1. **Abstract Types:** Instead of writing explicit type like i32 or float we can use the generics for different types by writing different code
2. **Adds Flexibility:** We can use different data types with the same piece of code.
3. **Reduces Code Duplication:** We can have the same piece of code or both for any two types.
4. **No Runtime Cost:** Unlike Object Traits, generics don't have runtime costs. The compiler generates the different types in the background during compile time.

## Generics
Usually the **generics type parameter** is represented by `<T>`. But you are free to use any.
### Structs
#### 1. Single placeholder type
Defining the struct with the <T> placeholder/generic type. 

```
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}
```

Let's try to use this for i32

```
pub fn main() {
    let i32_point = Point { x: 45, y: 90 };
    println!("x is {} and y is {}", i32_point.x, i32_point.y);
}
```
If you hover on the **i32_point** then you can find the type of variable is Point i32 i32. But it is not limited. You can even use the float for both x and y but they must be the same.

So how can we use the different types for the two fields x and y?

It can be done using the two placeholder

#### 2. Two placeholder  
**struct definition** 
```
struct TwoPoint<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}
```

let's test

```
pub fn main() {
    let explicit_point = TwoPoint { x: 9, y: 90.3 };
    println!(
        "explicit_point x is {} and y is {}",
        explicit_point.x, explicit_point.y
    );
}
```

Similarly we can two different data types for the x and y, even vectors.

### Enums 
#### 1. Generics with Enum

creating a result enum that will store the result whether pass, fail, or awaiting.
```
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Result<T> {
    Passed(T),
    Failed(T),
    Pending,
}
```

Used the `Debug` trait because the enum is not primitive because all the primitives include the debug capabilities/trait. 

Testing

```
pub fn main() {
  let result = Result::Passed(43);
  match result {
      Result::Passed(a) => println!("Student Passed with {}", a),
      Result::Failed(b) => println!("Student Failed with {}", b),
      Result::Pending => println!("Student result is pending"),
  }
}
```

You can use different generics types for Passed and Failed as shown in the above case.

#### 2. Using struct and enums together with generics
we are using the Result enum from the above example

```
struct Student<T> {
    name: String,
    roll_no: T,
    result: Result<T>,
}
```

Let's use it

```
pub fn main() {
  let student = Student {
      name: "Praveen".to_string(),
      roll_no: 78,
      result: Result::Passed(98),
  };

  match student.result {
      Result::Passed(a) => println!("Student Passed with {}", a),
      Result::Failed(b) => println!("Student Failed with {}", b),
      Result::Pending => println!("Student result is pending"),
  }
}
```

### Functions with Generics 
#### 1. Function with single generic type parameter and single trait

function definition
```
fn custom_add<T: std::ops::Add<Output = T>>(a: T, b: T) -> T {
    a + b
}
```

Here **Output=T** ensures that after the `+` or `-` result must be the same. It can be different if you wish too like the addition of two atoms can result in the molecule(`T+T=U`)

```
let a = 4;
let b = 5;
println!("sum of {} and {} is {}", a, b, custom_add(a, b));
```

#### 2. Function with single generic type parameter and multiple traits

```
fn custom_add_sub<T: std::ops::Add<Output = T> + std::ops::Sub<Output = T> + std::fmt::Debug>(
    a: T,
    b: T,
) -> T {
    // Debug trait is needed for this print statement
    println!("{:?} {:?}", a, b);
    a + b
}
```

Using the type

```
pub fn main() {
  println!("sub of {} and {} is {}", a, b, custom_add_sub(a, b));
}
```

I know it's easy for you now

#### 3.Function with multiple generic type parameters and multiple traits and where keyword
```
// using the where to define a generic type
fn custom_add_sub_mul<T, E>(a: T, b: T, c: E) -> T
where
    T: std::ops::Mul<Output = T> + std::ops::Add<Output = T> + std::ops::Sub<Output = T>,
    E: std::fmt::Debug,
{
    println!("{:?}", c);
    a * b
}
```

`where` keyword makes our code clearer. It doesn't have any impact on how the code run. 

```
pub fn main() {
  println!("mul of {} and {} is {}", a, b, custom_add_sub_mul(a, b, b));
}
``` 

#### 4. Functions with custom trait
Instead of using the predefined trait, we can use the custom trait as we like to.

```
trait SomeCustomTrait {
    fn bla_bla(&self, a: &str, b: &str) -> String;
}
#[derive(Debug)]
struct TestStruct {
    something: i32,
}

impl SomeCustomTrait for TestStruct {
    fn bla_bla(&self, a: &str, b: &str) -> String {
        self.something.to_string() + "-" + a + "-" + b
    }
}

fn do_this<T>(some_var: &T) -> String
where
    T: SomeCustomTrait + std::fmt::Debug,
{
    println!("{:?}", some_var);
    some_var.bla_bla("first", "second")
}
```
In the function, we have used our `SomeCustomTrait` along with the Debug. We can even add more. 

```
pub fn main() {
  let test = TestStruct { something: 1000 };
  let result = do_this(&test);
}
```

### Impl with Generics

```
struct ImplStruct<T, U> {
    field1: T,
    field2: U,
}

impl<T, U> ImplStruct<T, U>
where
    T: std::fmt::Debug,
    U: std::fmt::Debug,
{
    fn log_something(&self) {
        println!("{:?} {:?}", self.field1, self.field2);
    }
}
```

You can notice here the generics type is defined at the `impl block` instead of a struct but you can define it at both blocks but Impl block is a must.

```
pub fn main() {
  let impl_test = ImplStruct{
      field1:5.6,
      field2:vec![1,2,3],
  };
  impl_test.log_something();
```

So, we have covered the basics of Rust Generics but you can do a  lot more with Generics.
